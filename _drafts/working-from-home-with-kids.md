DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME

Seriously though. Do not try and work from home with young kids. Sure, you can make it work and do bits here and there but you try telling a four and a half year old that she can't help decorate the lovely lady who's paid good money for your cake's cake.

I often get asked how I do it and sometimes I wonder too. Juggling kids and business is not bloody easy, but it's the energy and joy i get from doing something that I love and bringing a vision to life that drives me. That, and daycare. I could not do what i do without the beautiful girls who have been taking care of both my babies a few days a week since they were both one. Throw in a super supportive (and also business owner) husband plus copious amounts of late nights, and you have a recipe for success.&nbsp;

When you have a vision; teamed with passion and obsession; you do what you gotta do to get it done. And in doing so, I hope i'm paving the way for my kids to follow their own dreams. They inspire me everyday and i only hope i can return the favour.
