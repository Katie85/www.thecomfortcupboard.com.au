I came up with this idea because I'm obsessed with this super easy gluten free tortilla recipe I found online a while back and I'm equally - if not more - obsessed with April form 3 Elements Health's stewed apples because: they taste amazing, my kids love them and in her words are the number one best food for gut health. WHO KNEW?\!

You can find our more about them on her Instagram @3elementshealth and i guarantee you'll learn a tonne more form her on all things health.

I've been procrastinating posting it because in typical me fashion I thought I needed to do a better photo shoot but I didn't get around to it so you're getting the originals because you need these in your life and who am I to make you wait any longer.
