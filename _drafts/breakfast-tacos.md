I came up with this idea because I'm obsessed with this super easy gluten free tortilla recipe I found online a while back and I'm equally - if not more - obsessed with April from 3 Elements Health's stewed apples because: they taste amazing, my kids love them and in her words are the number one best food for gut health. Who knew?\!

You can find our more about them on her Instagram @3elementshealth and I guarantee you'll learn a tonne more from her on all things health.

I've been procrastinating posting it because in typical me fashion I thought I needed to do a better photo shoot but I didn't get around to it so you're getting the originals because you need these in your life and who am I to make you wait any longer.

**3 ELEMENTS HEALTH STEWED APPLES**

5 apples (organic is best)

2 tsp ground cinnamon

Core and cut apples into small chunks.

Place in a heavy saucepan.

Add water to about 80% then add cinnamon.

Place the lid half on/half off and simmer for about 15 minutes or until tender.

Store in a glass airtight container in the fridge for 7 days or the freezer for 3 months.

**TORTILLAS**

1 cup chickpea or besan flour

1/3 cup arrowroot powder

1 cup water

Big pinch of salt

Mix the dry ingredients together and slowly pour the water in while whisking until smooth.

Fry in a thin layer in olive or coconut oil until golden brown on both sides.

Fill the warm tortillas with the stewed apple and top with some coconut cream and chopped walnuts.

You will become addicted.

You are welcome.
