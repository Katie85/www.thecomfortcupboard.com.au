Sometimes i cringe when i see photos of my cakes from when I was first starting out but it more so brings me joy and satisfaction as it's a fabulous reminder of how far they/I've come.

It's kinda like looking back at old photos of ourselves and cringing at what we were wearing, or how we had our hair; or eyebrows. (Who the eff signed off on the thin eyebrow trend?\! Never come back please.) At the time though it was the best we could do and totally cool for the times (maybe).

Our style and self is always evolving so we're naturally always coming up with new ideas and improving on old ones.

I think so many people are afraid to start something because they want to skip all the messiness and start in the middle - or even at the top\! But it doesn't work like that; no one is born an adult; we have to grow and evolve and learn and the same goes for our products and businesses.

I feel like by now I've developed my own style of cakes that are completely unique to me. We all start out being inspired by others (and will ALWAYS be inspired by others) taking bits and pieces from their styles and adding them to our own until it becomes a new unique style. There's a HUGE difference between being inspired and copying. Straight-up copying is not cool, and who would want to do that anyway when it's not sustainable and we're here to be original.

It's kinda like musicians playing cover songs as opposed to writing their own music but that's exactly what they do when they're starting out: they play music of other musicians who they look up to and inspire them until they create their own style of music. I love analogies, so there.

So all you have to do is start. Start where you are with what you have (physically and mentally). It's the starting that leads to learning and it's the learning that leads to growing and it's the growing that leads to mastery; along with copius amounts of practice, AND there's always room or improvement. I'm sure in five years time I'll look back at my cakes and this blog post and laugh.

Just, start.
