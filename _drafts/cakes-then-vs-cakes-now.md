Sometimes i cringe when i see photos of my cakes from when I was first starting out but it more so brings me joy and satisfaction as it's a fabulous reminder of how far they/I've come.

It's kinda like looking back at old photos of ourselves and cringing at what we were wearing, or how we had our hair; or eyebrows. (Who the eff signed off on the thin eyebrow trend?\! Never come back please.) At the time though it was the best we could do and totally cool for the times (maybe).

Our style and self is always evolving so we're naturally always coming up with new ideas and improving on old ones.

I think so many people are afraid to start something because they want to skip all the messiness and start in the middle - or even at the top\! But it doesn't work like that; no one is born an adult; we have to grow and evolve and learn and the same goes for our products and businesses.

I feel like I've really developed my own style of cakes that are completely unique to me. We all start out being inspired by others (and will ALWAYS be inspired by others) taking bits and pieces from their styles and adding them to our own until it becomes a new unique style.
