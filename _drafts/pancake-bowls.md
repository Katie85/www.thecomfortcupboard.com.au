Not enough people are talking about pancake bowls. I started making them a while back because intuitively it just made sense. You get way better pancake to sauce to topping ratio and they're easier to eat, AND you only need one piece of cutlery, not two. So then I did what I always do when I have an "original" idea: I googled it; to see how many other people had the same "original" idea, and that's when I realised that not enough people were talking about them. They were definitely out there in the world but with how good they are I thought they'd be more of a thing.

If you love pancakes you'll love these even more.

Welcome to the pancake bowl revolution.
