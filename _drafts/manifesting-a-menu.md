I'd been planning and creating the Dessert Bar menu for AGES; like some of the ideas i had go back years. Every time I'd have an idea I'd put it in the notes section in my phone - as you can see in the photo - and this is only half of it.&nbsp;

Some ideas would just sit there and some would HAVE to be tried immediately and I'd get obsessed with perfecting them.

Some would get put on the back burner because I'd get new ideas that needed to be attended to.

Part of me would fret that i needed to complete an idea before moving on to the next but the other part knew that I would always come back to them when the time was right. I have complete trust in the process of creation; even though I sometimes try to fight it and control it.

So basically my head was just filled with all these different sweet elements waiting to be paired with their perfect match.&nbsp;

Like our famous Choc Rocks. I came up with the idea of Choc Rocks as I needed a way to use up the off cuts of ice cream from our Ice cream sandwiches (waste not, want not).

I knew I was gonna coat the ice cream pieces in chocolate and call them Choc Rocks but I also needed a sauce and a topping for texture.&nbsp;&nbsp;
