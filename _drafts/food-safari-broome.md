What does an eight hour road trip with two young kids and giving birth have in common? Both are painful but totally worth it on the other side.

#### Food highlights, lowlights and lessons learned from three days in beautiful Broome.

&nbsp;

#### HIGHLIGHTS:

THE best mango smoothies you'll ever have from the Courthouse Markets and bulk papaya plus some pickled papaya (which was super delicious on crackers with cashew cream), oh, and some smoked salt plus mango chilli sauce, because, condiments\!

Watching my little boy demolish half a papaya. He has entered a fussy stage so this was incredibly thrilling. \#mumthings

Girls' lunch date with my little lady which happened to be next door to a crystal shop. Way to my heart. And I love when you go to places that do good salads as meals; like proper mealy kind of salads, random ingredients, good dressing, large servings. Happy.

A delicious lunch at Sydney Cove Oyster Bar - best part being they had a gluten free pasta option on the menu which I chose with one of my most fave pastas ever: crab, garlic, chilli, olive oil. It's the simple things, always.&nbsp;
