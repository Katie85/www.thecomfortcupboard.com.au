What does an eight hour road trip with two young kids and giving birth have in common? Both are painful but totally worth it on the other side.

#### Food highlights, lowlights and lessons learned from three days in beautiful Broome.

&nbsp;

#### HIGHLIGHTS:

THE best mango smoothies you'll ever have from the Courthouse Markets and bulk papaya plus some pickled papaya (which was super delicious on crackers with cashew cream), oh, and some smoked salt plus mango chilli sauce, because, condiments\!

Watching my little boy demolish half a papaya. He has entered a fussy stage so this was incredibly thrilling. \#mumthings
