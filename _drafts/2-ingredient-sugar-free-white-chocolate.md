I'm a long-time snacker of dates and cacao butter buttons because it's basically sugar-free white chocolate. You get all the joy of white chocolate: sweetness, butteriness, snappiness but all without the guiltiness.

A little warning though: straight up cacao butter may not everyone's cup of tea. I gave some to my mum once and she likened it to soap. I have never eaten soap so I have no idea what she's talking about.

It's a super easy recipe but you will need to temper\* the cacao butter with a thermometer. As much as I tried, you can't just marry the dates and cacao butter together and expect them to be happy. They will split.&nbsp;

\*Temper: To improve the consistency and hardness of the cacao butter and to re-set the crystals properly.
