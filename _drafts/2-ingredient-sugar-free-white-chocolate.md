I'm a long-time snacker of dates and cacao butter buttons, because, sugar-free white chocolate\! You get all the joy of chocolate: sweetness, butteriness, snappiness, all without the guiltiness.

A little warning though: straight up cacao butter may not everyone's cup of tea. I gave some to my mum once and she likened it to soap. I've never eaten soap so i have no idea what she's talking about.

It's a super easy recipe but you will need to temper\* the cacao butter. As much as I tried, you can't just marry the dates and cacao butter together and expect them to be happy. They will split.&nbsp;

\*Temper (chocolate)

To improve the consistency and hardness of the cacao butter and to re-set the crystals properly.

You will need a thermometer for this recipe.
