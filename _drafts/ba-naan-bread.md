I have to give my little girl credit for the name. One day she randomly called Banana Bread 'Ba Naan Bread' and I thought it was the most genius name ever for these flatbreads that I've been making for a while now. I think Ba-Naan bread might just become a thing; Google says it's not a thing so you heard it here first\!

#### INGREDIENTS

2 small super-ripe bananas

3/4 cup tapioca flour

3/4 cup almond meal (I use blanched)

3/4 cup coconut milk (can substitute any sort of milk)

Salt to taste

#### METHOD

Mash the bananas in a mixing bowl.

Add the dry ingredients then slowly add the milk while mixing together.

Heat a pan with some olive or coconut oil and fry until golden.

Serve with honey.

\*Blueberries work really well in this recipe too. Either in addition to the banana or instead of.
