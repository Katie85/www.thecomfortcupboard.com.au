**"You can't take kids there"**

**"They're too young to remember anyway"**

**"Flying with kids that far must be torture"**

These are just a few of the things we've heard around travelling with young kids but we love it. My husband and I love to travel (we met travelling) and always said that when we have kids we wouldn't let it stop us. And even though they may not remember i feel that every experience we have, no matter how young we are is shaping us into who we're becoming.

\*Flying long distance with young kids is like giving birth. It can be f\*cking painful at times but you get through it and forget about the pain soon enough.

**BEST THINGS WE ATE**

Me: Prawn salad with chilli and coconut milk.

Husband: Mud crab curry.

Zaine: "Spicy chippies" salt and pepper dalo chips (dalo is a local root vegetable also known as taro).

Casper: I'm gonna say hot chips. And papaya.

It's best to let go of usual "food rules". It's too hard to do gluten free, dairy free and refined sugar free the whole time when travelling, AND, it makes it fun free when you can't try all the new things on offer; so for us (And when i say us i mean the kids and i. my husband is definitely not down for this way of eating.) it goes somewhat out the window as it's more a choice to eat this way and not a necessity.

It's ok to turn a blind eye (\*it was hard) when your 4.5 year old wants a chocolate chip muffin and a chocolate croissant most mornings for breakfast, because, holidays\! I mean, who am i to deprive her of the pleasures of life.

Be armed with snacks everywhere you go. Like, everywhere. Whingy kids are easily remedied with snacks.

Nothing makes me happier than travelling to new places and experiencing their food culture, and there's no greater feeling than when your kids experiment with new and different foods and love them.
