**"You can't take kids there"**

**"They're too young to remember anyway"**

**"Flying with kids that far must be torture"**

These are just a few of the things we've heard around travelling with young kids but we love it. My husband and I&nbsp;love to travel (we met travelling) and always said that when we have kids we wouldn't let it stop us. And even though they may not remember i feel that every experience we have, no matter how young we are is shaping us in to who we are becoming.

\*Flying long distance with young kids is like giving birth. It can be f\*cking painful at times but you get through it and forget about the pain soon enough.
