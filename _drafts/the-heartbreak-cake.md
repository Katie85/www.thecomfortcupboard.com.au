Day in the life of an entrepreneur/human.

My recent Mother's Day was going fabulously until I was confronted with a customer's heart cake photo. This has nothing to do with the quality of her photo (I LOVE and appreciate it so much when I get tagged in customer's pics) and everything to do with comparison and perfectionism.

I instantly went spiralling into anxiety. I could not relax.

I kept wishing I'd done better.

I kept trying to justify myself, to myself.

I kept thinking that everyone must hate their cake and would be thinking I'm a phoney and a rip off - HELLO Imposter Syndrome.&nbsp;

I kept wishing I hadn't put the price up from last year.

I kept comparing the photos and rehashing the sick feeling in my stomach.

I kept imagining everyone eating their cake and bagging it out. (Geez I hope you weren't.)

I was waiting for someone to do up a "what you paid for vs what you got" meme.

Could not let it go that I'd accidentally put five pieces of marshmallow instead of the six i had on the promo shit. IDIOT.

But when the spiralling began to slow and I started to come back to reality, I realised...

Customers' photos are never gonna look as good as your own. This&nbsp;
