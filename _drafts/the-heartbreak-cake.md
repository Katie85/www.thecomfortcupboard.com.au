Day in the life of an entrepreneur/human.

My recent Mother's Day was going fabulously until I was confronted with a customer's heart cake photo. This has nothing to do with the quality of her photo (I LOVE and appreciate it so much when i get tagged in customer's pics) and everything to do with comparison and perfectionism.

I instantly went spiralling into anxiety. I could not relax.

I kept wishing i'd done better.

I kept trying to justify myself, to myself.

I kept thinking that everyone must hate their cake and would be thinking i'm a phoney and a rip off - HELLO imposter syndrome.&nbsp;

I kept wishing i hadn't put the price up from last year.

I kept comparing the photos and rehashing the sick feeling in my stomach.
