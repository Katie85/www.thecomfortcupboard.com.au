How nostalgic are chocolate freckles?\! The quintessential childhood sweet. Every party I ever went to had them on the table and every lolly bag I ever took home contained at least one.

The child inside of me still likes to eat all that fun stuff, only know she's a woman who cares about her (and her family's) health and wants it all; and why the heck can't we have it?\! We can.

This is why I do what I do cause I'm that girl who likes to eat all the fun stuff but also cares about her health, and why the heck can't we have it?\! We can.
