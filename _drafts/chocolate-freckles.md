How nostalgic are chocolate freckles? The quintessential childhood sweet. Every party I ever went to had them on the table and every lolly bag I ever took home contained at least one.

The child inside of me still likes to eat all that fun stuff, only know she's a woman who cares about her (and her family's) health, and wants it all; and why the heck can't we have it?\! We can.

#### INGREDIENTS

1/2 cup 55% vegan chocolate chips - I get mine [here](https://www.goodness.com.au/organic-dark-chocolate-drops-55-cocoa-250g/)&nbsp;but if you live in Karratha you can get them from Barefoot creations

2-3 tbsps Cocofetti sprinkles (AVAILABLE ONLINE SOON)

Melt the chocolate in the microwave for 1.5 minutes then stir to melt through.

Let it cool slightly so it's not so runny.

Pipe circles or pour from a jug onto a lined tray.

Sprinkle &nbsp;with Cocofetti and put in the fridge or freezer to set.

Eat and be taken back to childhood.
