I came up with this recipe 2 Christmases ago and it's tradidtion now to make them each year. I'm cutting it fine this year to get it done, because, LIFE, but what would be a 2020 finale withour a last minute Gingerbread sesh anyway.

They're completelyrefined sugar free, dairy free, gluten free and egg free\! My alternative to the usual white royal icing is a honey marshmallow fluff icing. It still gives that super white Christmasy vibe plus it adds a nice flavour and texture. The cookies are then dusted with coconut flour as an alternative to icing sugar (genius right) which stops the marshmallow stickiness and looks like snow.
