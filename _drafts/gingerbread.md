I came up with this recipe 2 Christmases ago and it's tradidtion now to make them each year. I'm cutting it fine this year to get it done, because, LIFE, but what would be a 2020 finale withour a last minute Gingerbread sesh anyway.

They're completelyrefined sugar free, dairy free, gluten free and egg free\! My alternative to the usual white royal icing is a honey marshmallow fluff icing. It still gives that super white Christmasy vibe plus it adds a nice flavour and texture. The cookies are then dusted with coconut flour as an alternative to icing sugar (genius right) which stops the marshmallow stickiness and looks like snow.

Please make sure you do this if you have kids and tag us in your pics\!![](/uploads/gingerbreadman.jpg){: width="1536" height="2048"}
