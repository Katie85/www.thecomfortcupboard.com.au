Winter has well and truly hit us up here in the Pilbara; and when I say hit us I mean we're averaging around 28C days. We're little precious up here so it's still classed as hot chocolate weather.

I came up with this (genius I thought) idea last winter because chocolate and raspberries are one of my fave flavour combos and why not make a hot drink out of them.

The edition of the rosewater marshmallows take it to the next level. Those who know me know that I LOVE rosewater and use it where ever I&nbsp;can and those who don't know me now know that i really love rosewater and will see it frequent my recipes. I use Cortas rosewater which you can purchase here&nbsp;[...](https://internationalgroceries.com.au/Cortas%20Rose%20Water){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;It's the real deal - no artificial flavours or colours, just distilled water and edible rose petal extract.
