Winter has well and truly hit us up here in the Pilbara; and when I say hit us I mean we're averaging around 28C days. We're little precious up here so it's still classed as hot chocolate weather.

I came up with this (genius I thought) idea last winter because chocolate and raspberries are one of my fave flavour combos and why not make a hot drink out of them.

The edition of the rosewater marshmallows take it to the next level. Those who know me know that I LOVE rosewater and use it where ever I&nbsp;can and those who don't know me now know that i really love rosewater and will see it frequent my recipes. I use Cortas rosewater which you can purchase [here](https://internationalgroceries.com.au/Cortas%20Rose%20Water){: target="_blank"}. It's the real deal - no artificial flavours or colours, just distilled water and edible rose petal extract.

**Makes 1 cup**

**1 tbsp cacao powder**

**3/4 tsp [freeze dried raspberry powder&nbsp;](http://chefspantry.com.au/product/freeze-dried-raspberry-powder-200g-fresh-as/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;OR 3 tsp raspberry puree&nbsp;**

**1 tbsp maple syrup**

**1/4 boiling water**

**2/3 cup milk of your choice (i use coconut cream)**

&nbsp;
