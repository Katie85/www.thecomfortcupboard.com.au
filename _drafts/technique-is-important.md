It's crazy when you think about how you can take one ingredient; apply different techniques to it; and reap completely different results.

Like a banana: you can caramelise it in a pan with some butter to get the most amazing rich caramel flavour from it; you can freeze-dry it to create a crunchy, crumbly texture; dehydrate it and you get a chewy, almost taffy likeness from it; and my favourite: freeze it, then process with some coconut cream for the most creamiest soft serve ever that happens to be vegan and sugar free\!

Different techniques can bring out different flavours in a food. Like dry ginger vs fresh ginger. They have such a different flavour profile and the only thing setting them apart is TECHNIQUE. Same goes for dried mint and fresh mint. There is nooooo way you can use these two interchangeably - i don't care what anyone says, they are completely different.
