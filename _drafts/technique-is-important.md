It's crazy when you think about how you can take one ingredient; apply different techniques to it; and reap completely different results.

Like a banana: you can caramelise it in a pan with some butter to get the most amazing rich caramel flavour from it; freeze-drying it will create a crunchy, crumbly texture; dehydrate it and you'll get a chewy, almost taffy likeness from it; and my favourite: freezing it, then processing with some coconut cream for the most creamiest soft serve ever that happens to be vegan and sugar free\!

Different techniques can bring out different flavours in a food. Like dry ginger vs fresh ginger. They have such a different flavour profile and the only thing setting them apart is TECHNIQUE. Same goes for dried mint and fresh mint. There is nooooo way you can use these two interchangeably - i don't care what anyone says, they are completely different.

Technique is the key to creating different textures. Look at sugar: you heat it to a certain temperature, add some dried coconut and bi carb soda, let it set, bash it with hammer, and you have an insanely addictive&nbsp;[...](/dairy%20free/egg%20free/gluten%20free/refined%20sugar%20free/vegan/2020/02/24/coconut-brittle.html){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;coconut brittle. Anyone who's tried our Choc Rocks and Donut Delight would 100% agree that they would not be the same without the coconut brittle on top.

Texture (or lack thereof) will 100% make or break a dish.

So of course quality ingredients are important in creating good food but technique is crucial to creating amazing food.
