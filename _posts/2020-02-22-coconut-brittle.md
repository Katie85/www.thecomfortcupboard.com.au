Coconut Brittle features on two of our Dessert Bar dishes and completely makes them. Eat it straight up or bash it with a hammer (not kidding) to create a super texture-y topping for your desserts.

1 cup coconut sugar

1/2 cup water

1/2 cup flaked coconut&nbsp;

1/4 tsp bi carb soda&nbsp;

Salt

Combine coconut sugar and water in a saucepan and put on low. It must be on super low the whole time otherwise is it will burn. Place your candy thermometer in the pot and let it bubble away.&nbsp;

Line a medium size tray or a large plate with baking paper.

Once it reaches 115 degrees c (it will take a while so be patient but keep checking on it) add the flaked coconut.&nbsp;

Continue to monitor the temp until it reaches hard crack stage on your thermometer 150 degrees c.&nbsp;

Quickly add your bi carb and stir through. It will bubble up and become foamy.&nbsp;

PLEASE BE CAREFUL WORKING WITH HOT SUGAR\!

Pour onto baking paper and flatten into a thin layer using a spatula. Sprinkle with salt (optional but worth it\!)

Let it cool then set up completely in the fridge. Break into shards and store in the fridge or freezer especially for you live in a humid place.

It is addictive. You have been warned.&nbsp;
