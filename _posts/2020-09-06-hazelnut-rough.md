Keeping with the chocolate hazelnut theme this recipe is the easiest thing you’ll ever make and was born when I combined the leftover chocolate sauce from The Comfort Cupboard Dessert Bar menu and hazelnut meal. The texture took me back to those old school chocolate bars ‘Golden Rough‘, hence the name.&nbsp;<br><br><br>**INGREDIENTS**&nbsp;

1/2 cup cacao powder

1/2 cup coconut oil (I use purified and deodorised so it doesn’t have a strong flavour)

2 tbsp maple syrup (add more if you like a sweeter chocolate)&nbsp;

5 tbsp hazelnut meal

Pinch of salt&nbsp;

&nbsp;

**METHOD**

Mix the cacao powder and maple syrup just slightly - you don’t want to over mix it.

Slowly add the oil while whisking at the same time.

Fold in the hazelnut meal and salt then pour onto a lined tray.

Freeze until set then break apart as desired. Store in the fridge or freezer.

Flavour will get better as the days go on.
