&nbsp;

2 cups cherries (frozen)

2 small red apples (peeled and cooked)

3/4 cup rice malt syrup

1/2 tbsp citrus pectin

3 tsp rosewater

1 1/2 tsp agar agar

1 recipe of our Chocolate Ice Magic

Measure out 2 cups of frozen cherries to defrost. Peel and chop and cook apples until soft.Line a 20x20cm square tin or container with baking paper (can be a little smaller but no larger).Blitz cherries and apple in a blender to make a pur&eacute;e. Add back to a saucepan.Add the rest of the ingredients and whisk to combine fully. Put on a medium heat and bring to boil. Take off the heat as soon as it reaches boiling.Pour into lined tin and let cool slightly before putting in the fridge overnight or at least 6hrs.Remove from the tin and cut into small squares or rectangles. Freeze for at least an hour. This will ensure the chocolate sets quickly when dipping.Make the Chocolate Ice Magic. Dip the frozen squares into the chocolate then dip again once set. Store in the fridge or freezer (itâ€™s nice to try both ways as you get 2 different textures from the filling). Enjoy\!
