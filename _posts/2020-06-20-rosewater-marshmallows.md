Those who know me know that I LOVE rosewater and use it wherever I can and those who don't know me now know that I really love rosewater and will see it frequent my recipes with these beautiful marshmallows being no exception. I use Cortas rosewater which you can purchase [here](https://internationalgroceries.com.au/Cortas%20Rose%20Water){: target="_blank"}. It's the real deal - no artificial flavours or colours, just distilled water and edible rose petal extract.

&nbsp;

**IN A SAUCEPAN&nbsp;**

#### 1/4 cup water

#### 1/2 cup honey&nbsp;

#### 1/2 tsp vanilla extract&nbsp;

#### Pinch salt

&nbsp;

**IN A MIXER**

#### 1/4 cup water

#### 1 1/2 tbsp gelatin

#### 1 tsp beetroot powder (optional for colouring)

#### 1 1/2 tsp rose water&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Put the saucepan on medium heat, monitoring with a candy thermometer bring up to soft ball stage (112 degrees c).

Take off the heat and turn the mixer on medium speed.

Slowly pour in the hot syrup then turn mixer to high and beat for around 10 minutes or until stiff peaks have formed.

Line a large container with baking paper and put marshmallow mix in to set.

Set in the fridge for 2 hours then cut with a warm knife (dip in hot water).
