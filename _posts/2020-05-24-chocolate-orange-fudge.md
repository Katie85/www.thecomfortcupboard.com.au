This fudge was actually one of the first recipes i ever gave away. I made it the other day and had forgotten how good it is\! It's super easy AND it's sugar free. You're welcome.

#### INGREDIENTS

4 medjool dates&nbsp;

1/3 cup cashew butter

1/4 cup cacao powder

2 tbsp coconut cream

1 1/2 tbsp coconut oil

1/4 tsp vanilla extract

3 big pinches salt

2 drops doTERRA wild orange essential oil

&nbsp;

#### METHOD

Pit and cut the dates. Whiz in a food processor until smooth.

Add the rest of the ingredients to the food processor and whiz until combined.

Press into a small lined tin or container.

Refrigerate until solid then cut as desired.

Told you it was easy.
