I'm a long-time snacker of dates and cacao butter together because it's basically sugar-free white chocolate. You get all the joy of white chocolate: sweetness, butteriness, snappiness; all without the guiltiness.

A little warning though: straight up cacao butter may not everyone's cup of tea. I gave some to my mum once and she likened it to soap. I've never eaten soap so I have no idea what she's talking about. I love it\!

It's a super easy recipe but you will need to temper\* the cacao butter with a thermometer. And as much as I tried, you can't just blend the dates and cacao butter together and expect them to be happy. They will split.&nbsp;

\*Temper: To improve the consistency and hardness of the cacao butter and to re-set the crystals properly.

&nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

5 medjool dates

1/3 cup cacao butter

&nbsp;

### METHOD

Chop or grate the cacao butter. Grating is best for even melting.

Put half in a glass or stainless steel bowl and set the other half aside.

Place the glass/stainless bowl over a pot of simmering water. Watching with the thermometer, take off the heat once it reaches approx. 55C.

Add the other half of the cacao butter to bring the temperature down. This is tempering.&nbsp;

While that's happening de-seed the dates and chop into 0.5cm pieces.&nbsp;

Line a small tin or container (you want something around 5cmx12cm).

Cover the base with the chopped dates. You don't want to press them in too firm as you want the cacao butter to run through the gaps.

Once the cacao butter reaches approx. 28C pour it over the dates.

Set in the fridge or freezer.

Once set cut as desired.&nbsp;
