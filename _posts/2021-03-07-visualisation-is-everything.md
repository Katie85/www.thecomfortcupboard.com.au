Visualisation is everything. Like, everything.&nbsp;

You have to be constantly visualising what it is that you want and who you will be when you eventually get it.&nbsp;

You have to be tapping into the feeling it is that &nbsp;you’re searching for. We’re all just chasing a feeling. It’s not about the thing, it’s about the feeling the thing brings and it’s the feeling that manifests the creation into reality.

You have to believe it before you will see it.

You have to trust yourself before anyone will put their trust in you.

You have to love what you do before anyone else will love it too.&nbsp;

You have to choose yourself and you have to believe in yourself and dare I say it, you have to love your damn self.

Because how you feel about yourself is the most important thing. That’s where you start. That’s the beginning of getting everything it is that you want.&nbsp;
