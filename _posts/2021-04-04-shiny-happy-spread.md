My little girl had been talking about Nutella non-stop. She's never had it in her life and it doesn't live in our house so I have no idea why; or maybe that is exactly the reason why (the poor deprived child); so I came up with an alternative - cause that's what I do - but I also wanted to keep it nut free for a school lunchbox treat. It's super super easy and I'm definitely not reinventing the wheel but here is my versionâ€¦

#### INGREDIENTS&nbsp;

1/2 cup quality honey

1/2 cup + 2 tbsps cacao powder

1 tsp vanilla extract

Big pinch salt

Add honey to a bowl.

Sift in cacao then add the vanilla and salt.

Mix slowly with a spatula to combine. It takes a little while for it to come together.

Store in a jar at room temp.
