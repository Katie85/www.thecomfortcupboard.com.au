I started working in these about a year ago but then they fell by the wayside because a) i got busy, b) I didn't think they were perfect enough to be of any desire to anyone and c) I thought they were too simple and wanted complicate them to try make them perfect. (Why do we do this?) But then i realised that they tasted bloody amazing and didn't need to be exactly like Ferrero Rochers to be worthy. So here they are\!

#### &nbsp;

### INGREDIENTS

Makes 8

3/4 cup hazelnut meal

2 tbsp cacao powder

1 1/2 tbsp maple syrup

1/2 tsp vanilla extract

Big pinch of salt

**8 whole hazelnuts**

**1/3 cup coarsely chopped hazelnuts**

**1/2 cup chocolate chips - i use [these](https://www.goodness.com.au/organic-dark-chocolate-drops-55-cocoa-5kg/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you're in Karratha you can purchase them from Barefoot Creations.**

**Edible gold leaf (optional) purchase [here](https://www.bakeboss.com.au/product/8243-cake-craft-edible-24k-gold-leaf-5-sheets){: target="_blank" rel="noopener"}**

### METHOD

Put the hazelnut meal, cacao, maple syrup, vanilla and salt in a bowl and mix until all combined.

Melt the chocolate chips in the microwave.

Roll the mixture into 8 balls stuffing a whole hazelnut in the centre of each.&nbsp;

Roll the balls in the coarsely chopped hazelnuts pressing them in to help them stick.

Dip each ball in the melted chocolate a place on a tray lined with baking paper. Set in the fridge or freezer if you can't wait and really want to eat one.

Roll the balls in the gold leaf. These make a great gift idea\!

\*Disclaimer: gold leaf can be a nightmare to work with. Your best bet is Youtube tutorials.
