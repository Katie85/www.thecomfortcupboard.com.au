Winter has well and truly hit us up here in the Pilbara; and when I say hit us I mean we're averaging around 28C days. We're little precious up here so it's still classed as hot chocolate weather.

I came up with this (genius I thought) idea last winter because chocolate and raspberries are one of my fave flavour combos and why not make a hot drink out of them.

The edition of the rosewater marshmallows take it to the next level. [CLICK HERE FOR RECIPE](https://www.thecomfortcupboard.com.au/dairy%20free/gluten%20free/refined%20sugar%20free/egg%20free/2020/06/20/rosewater-marshmallows.html){: target="_blank"}

**Makes 1 cup**

**1 tbsp cacao powder**

**3/4 tsp [freeze dried raspberry powder&nbsp;](http://chefspantry.com.au/product/freeze-dried-raspberry-powder-200g-fresh-as/){: target="_blank"}&nbsp;OR 3 tsp raspberry puree&nbsp;**

**1 tbsp maple syrup**

**1/4 boiling water**

**2/3 cup milk of your choice (I use coconut cream)**

Add the cacao powder, raspberry powder and maple syrup to a mug while you wait for the kettle to boil. At the same time heat your milk in a pot or in the microwave.

Add the boiling water and mix together until smooth. Add milk and stir.

Add marshmallows for ultimate hot chocolate experience.
