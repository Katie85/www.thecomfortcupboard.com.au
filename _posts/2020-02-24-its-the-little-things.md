Sometimes I forget how much work goes into creating something. I lost count of the amount of cookie trials I did to get these refined sugar free, vegan, gluten free cookies just right for our ice cream sandwiches; the ice cream I tinkered with over a couple of years to balance the flavours perfectly; and the sprinkles (my own original creation), I’m still tinkering with, trying to get all the colours just right so they’re ready to start selling by the jar. I tend to get caught up in the doing but really need to stop and celebrate the small wins, because essentially, it’s all of the small wins that make up the big wins. There is no big without the small.
