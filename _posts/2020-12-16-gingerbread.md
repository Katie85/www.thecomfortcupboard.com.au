I came up with this recipe 2 Christmases ago and it's tradition now to make them each year. I'm cutting it fine this year to get it done, because, LIFE; but what would be a 2020 finale without a last minute Gingerbread sesh anyway.

They're completely refined sugar free, dairy free, gluten free and egg free\! My alternative to the usual white royal icing is a honey marshmallow fluff icing. It still gives that super white Christmasy vibe plus it adds a nice flavour and texture. The cookies are then dusted with coconut flour as an alternative to icing sugar (genius right) which stops the marshmallow stickiness and looks like snow.

And please make sure you do this below if you have kids and tag us in your pics\!

#### WET INGREDIENTS

1/2 cup coconut sugar - mix with 1/4 cup water and microwave for 30 seconds to dissolve sugar

1/2 cup coconut nectar (can replace with coconut sugar)

1/2 cup coconut oil

1/2 tsp vanilla extract

#### DRY INGREDIENTS

1 + 1/3 cup besan flour

3/4 cup arrowroot

2 tsp baking powder

1 tsp baking soda

1/4 tsp xanthan gum

2 tsp ginger powder

1 tsp cinnamon powder

1/2 tsp nutmeg

1/2 clove powder

Big pinch salt

#### METHOD

Place all ingredients in a food processor and pulse together until combined.

Alternatively, add wet ingredients to dry and mix by hand until it comes together.

Refrigerate dough 1 hour.

Preheat oven to 180C.

Roll dough out into a well floured surface.

Cut into desired shapes.

Place in a lined baking tray and pop in the freezer for 30 mins.

Cook for approx 4-5 minutes depending on your oven. Just keep checking them for colour. They don't take long at all to cook.

Let cool on a rack then get onto the marshmallow fluff icing.

#### MARSHMALLOW FLUFF

### In a mixer

1/4 cup water

1 + 1/2 tsp gelatin powder

1 drop peppermint essential oil (optional)

### In a saucepan

1/4 cup water

1/4 cup honey

Pinch salt

#### METHOD

Mix gelatin and water together.

Heat saucepan mixture to soft ball stage on your candy thermometer (115C). If you have a candy thermometer just boil for around 5 minutes.

Turn mixer on low, slowly and carefully pour in hot mixture.

Best until light and fluffy and super thick, approx 10 minutes.

Put icing into piping bag ready for decorating\!

NOTE: the icing will set fairly quickly. If it does just pop in the microwave for 10 seconds and mix back together.
