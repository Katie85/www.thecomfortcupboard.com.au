The inspiration for this recipe came when I was searching for a bliss ball recipe to make with my little girl that had pistachios in it as I had a heap to use up. Enter: ‘Salted Chocolate Tahini Bliss Balls’ from Bon Appetit magazine&nbsp;[https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salted-chocolate-tahini-bliss-balls](https://www.bonappetit.com/recipe/salted-chocolate-tahini-bliss-balls).

Someone asked me once about the etiquette when using other’s recipes and my advice was that recipes are there to inspire and if you do use someone’s recipe then just make sure you credit them. Yes, I’ve tweaked this one slightly to add my own spin on it by adding orange essential oil and changing the form of it to a brownie, with a chocolate topping, but it’s definitely not “mine”. It’s bloody delicious though and the flavours get better as the days go on. You’re welcome.

&nbsp;

## INGREDIENTS

### <br>**BASE**

1 1/3 cups + 2tbsp unsalted, shelled, raw pistachios, divided

8 medjool dates, pitted

2/3 cups tahini

1/2 cup maple syrup

1/2 cup cacao powder

1/2 tsp salt

2 drops Doterra Wild Orange essential oil

&nbsp;

### **CHOCOLATE TOPPING&nbsp;**

1/2 cup cacao powder

1/2 cup coconut oil

2 tbsp maple syrup

&nbsp;

### **METHOD**

Whiz the pistachios in a food processor until broken down by not super fine.

Add the rest of the ingredients and whiz until combined.&nbsp;

Press into a lined tin (I used an 18x18cm), then chill until firm.

Make the chocolate topping by whisking the cacao powder and maple together then slowly adding the coconut oil. Whisk until silky smooth. Pour on top of the base.&nbsp;

Chop the remaining 2 tbsps of pistachios and sprinkle on top with the sesame seeds. Chill until the chocolate has set.

Cut as desired. I like to cut mine small so i can eat "more" and feel less guilty.
