I like to call these Everyday Pancakes as they're something i could happily eat everyday for breakfast. Sure, pancakes smothered in maple syrup and ice cream are nice but my thighs wouldn't appreciate me eating them on a daily basis. These are feel good pancakes. Everyday pancakes you can feel good about eating.

&nbsp;

#### **DRY**

1/2 cup quinoa flour

1/2 cup buckwheat flour

1/2 tsp baking powder

1/2 tsp baking soda

1/2 tsp cinnamon powder

#### WET

1/2 cup almond milk

1/2 cup coconut milk

1 tbsp maple syrup

1 tbsp apple cider vinegar

1 tbsp coconut oil

1 tsp vanilla extract

&nbsp;

Put dry ingredients in one bowl and wet in another. Slowly pour the wet into the dry, whisking together at the same time.

I find these work best if made the night before and left in the fridge. It gives the flour enough time to fully hydrate and you end up with super fluffy pancakes.

If you do make on the day just give the mix 30 minutes in the fridge before cooking. I love cooking mine in olive oil.

### TOPPINGS

Soaked chia seeds, coconut yoghurt, almond butter, berries. The options for toppings are endless. I like to mix it up depending on what i have at the time and what's in season.
