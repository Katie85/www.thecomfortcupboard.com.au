      <h3><span class="color-primary lh">Hello. My name is Katie and I’m addicted to food. I’m the founder and creator of The Comfort Cupboard, where we’ve been making fun foods less naughty since 2014.</h3>

<p>I fell into cooking in 2004 and have never looked back. I’ve worked in kitchens in Australia, London, Cork, and Auckland and have gained a tonne of inspiration travelling the world, which is my biggest passion next to food.</p>

<p>The Comfort Cupboard was born out of the constant craving for sweet stuff but wanting to be kind to my body at the same time. I wanted to eat “fun foods”; you know the ones: donuts, cookies, cakes, lollies, chocolate, ice cream, desserts; the ones that bring you endless comfort; but I wanted to stay in shape at the same time - which might I add - I like to do with as little effort possible, eating the foods I want to eat whenever I want, thank you very much.
</p>

<p>It was time these foods had a makeover to keep up with the health conscious world that a lot of us now choose to live in, so in 2014 upon returning from another stint travelling the world, I was straight back in the kitchen; and by straight back in I mean the week we flew back I was in my parents kitchen experimenting with the cannellini bean frosting recipe idea I had while staying in an air bnb in Buenos Aires. This is now the Comfort Cupboard’s signature frosting - and I’m not giving away the recipe for it. Yet.
