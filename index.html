    <section class="about font">
      <p> THE COMFORT CUPBOARD is a POP-UP BAKERY specialising in unique cakes and other sweet stuff. We don’t use refined sugar or dairy and use organic ingredients where possible. We specialize in gluten free + vegan and dabble in paleo so we pretty much have you all covered.

      After cooking professionally since 2005, qualifying in both Commercial Cookery and Patisserie (self-taught), after travelling the world gaining inspiration, and most importantly, after countless experiments in the kitchen, I baked my brainchild into a business!

      The concept was built around creating your typical naughty bakery fare in a less typical naughty way. Replacing the usual white sugar, butter, cream, cocoa with more nourishing (organic) ingredients like spelt and besan flours, coconut sugar, coconut oil and decorating cakes naturally with freeze dried fruit, dried coconut, rose petals, cake crumb and nuts.

      I’m always experimenting with new and classic ideas to create recipes that not only taste amazing but are more beneficial to a healthier, cleaner lifestyle.

      CARAVAN OPEN SATURDAYS 8:30 – 11:30am @DREAMER’S HILL, KARRATHA
